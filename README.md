Right now, it is just a place to play with markdown.

Most of this is from John Gruber's [Markdown Basics] [basics]

Some of these words *are emphasized*.
Some of these words _are emphasized also_.
    
Use two asterisks for **strong emphasis**.
Or, if you prefer, __use two underscores instead__.

## Lists ##

Unordered (bulleted) lists use asterisks, pluses, and hyphens (`*`,
`+`, and `-`) as list markers. These three markers are interchangable.

   * first item
   * second item
   * third item

Ordered lists apparently just use numbers:

   1. first item
   2. second item
   3. third item

Markdown supports two styles for creating links: *inline* and
*reference*. With both styles, you use square brackets to delimit the
text you want to turn into a link.

Inline-style links use parentheses immediately after the link text.
For example:

    This is an [example link](http://example.com/).

Output:

    <p>This is an <a href="http://example.com/">
    example link</a>.</p>

Optionally, you may include a title attribute in the parentheses:

    This is an [example link](http://example.com/ "With a Title").

Output:

    <p>This is an <a href="http://example.com/" title="With a Title">
    example link</a>.</p>
